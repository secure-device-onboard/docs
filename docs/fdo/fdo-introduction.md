The FDO project is developing an implementation of the [FIDO Device Onboarding specification](https://fidoalliance.org/specs/FDO/fido-device-onboard-v1.0-ps-20210323/) by the FIDO Alliance.

The [FDO PRI](https://github.com/secure-device-onboard/pri-fidoiot) component has been added to the LF Edge Secure Device Onboard project.  It is a reference implementation of the specification working draft, and also implements the service modules required to exercise the complete system: Device, Manufacturer, Rendezvous Server, and Owner.  See the [readme](https://github.com/secure-device-onboard/pri-fidoiot/blob/master/README.md) in the PRI-FIDOIOT project repository for details on the implementation and how to get it set up and running.  See the [release notes](https://github.com/secure-device-onboard/release-fidoiot/releases) for PRI-FIDOIOT 0.3 for a summary of features and capabilities implemented (or not) in the 0.3 release.

The [FDO Client SDK](https://github.com/secure-device-onboard/client-sdk-fidoiot) component has been added to the LF Edge Secure Device Onboard project. A [design document](fdo-client-sdk-design.md) outlining the changes required to support the new FIDO Device Onboard protocol for devices has also been added to the FDO documentation.  Comments are welcome and can be submitted via the FDO documentation GitHub repository.
