The IOT Platform SDK consists of Owner Companion Service (OCS) that can be implemented to integrate any other device management solution.

Both the OPS and To0Scheduler are bound to the OCS by a set of pre-defined contracts, as specified in the module `libocs`, that can be implemented to perform certain pre-defined tasks. The contract is backed by a set of REST APIs/interfaces, where each individual REST API/interface is tied to exactly one method from the pre-defined contract. Each REST API/interface carries out only the corresponding task, and accepts/returns only the corresponding Message Type object.

The implementation of these REST contracts in an OCS can be done in any programming language. A sample java-based reference implementation of OCS is provided by the module `ocsfs` that uses file-system as database. As such, both OPS and To0Scheduler will work out-of-the-box with any implementation of OCS that supports the pre-defined REST contracts.

!!! Note
    The implementation of the pre-defined contracts can be backed by non-REST interfaces as well. However, this would invlove updates to both OPS and To0Scheduler to facilitate communication with the newly defined interface at OCS. Such a change would involve, but is not limited to, updates to existing class `RestClient.java` at both OPS and To0Scheduler.

## Rest Contracts between OCS(Server) and OPS/To0Scheduler(Client)

The following are the pre-defined REST API specifications for all the resource paths that must be implemented and exposed by an OCS implementation. Both, OPS and To0Scheduler make requests to the OCS implementation, as clients, using this format.

## Rest Contracts between To0Scheduler(Server) and OCS(Client)

An OCS implementation must, also, act as a client to trigger TO0 for set of devices, by making the following request to To0Scheduler. To0Scheduler accepts the request from OCS to initiate TO0 for the list of devices.

### *To2DeviceSessionInfo*
This JSON* structure represents the complete TO2 session information. It's a combination of multiple structures, where each structure is either null or contains values. If any of the structure is null, OCS treats the structure as non-updatable in its store, while OPS considers the same to be an erroneous case.
