A segmented computing environment which runs a body of code that is believed to be trusted when installed. The reason for this original belief can vary. It is typical to cryptographically link a TEE back to its original trusted state, such as using digital signatures or crypto-hashes to prove that it has not been tampered with. The key used to do this is commonly called the Hardware Root of Trust. |
| TLS                                                 | Acronym - Transport Level Security |
| TO0                                                 | Acronym - Transfer of Ownership, step 0: establishes a connection with the Owner to the Rendezvous server and creates trust that it has ownership of an Ownership Voucher so Service Info can be transmitted. |
| TO0Client                                           | A utility program that runs the TO0 protocol. It takes an Ownership Voucher as input, runs the TO0 protocol, resulting in the OP being stored in the Rendezvous server. |
| TO1                                                 | Acronym - Transfer of Ownership, step 1: Establishes a connection from a Device to the Rendezvous server. |
| TO2                                                 | Acronym - Transfer of Ownership, step 2: Establishes a trusted, secure connection between the Device and the final Owner and enables the Owner to configure the device as per the requirement from DMS. |
| TOFU                                                | Acronym - Trust On First Use |
| TPM                                                 | Acronym - Trusted Platform Module |
| URI                                                 | Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) |
| URL                                                 | Acronym - Uniform Resource Locator. A web address, is a reference to a web resource that specifies its location on a computer network and a mechanism for retrieving it. A URL is a specific type of Uniform Resource Identifier (URI). |
| Verifier Exclusion List Revocation                       | When the Verifier suspects that a member key has been compromised based on the verifiers key revocation criteria, the verifier will add the member to an exclusion list based on the name-based signature generated by the member. The VerifierRL nomenclature is used to denote the revocation list corresponding to this method. |
| VerifierRL                                          | Acronym - Verifier Revocation List. See above. |
